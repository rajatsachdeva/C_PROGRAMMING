# Addresses and Indirection

`Arrays in C are just sequential data items stored in some location in memory.
Name of the array is the address of the array`

`Unlike many other languages, C doesn't have dedicated string data type, strings are created using character arrays. In C '\0' (null character) is treated as string terminator`

`char str1[] and char *str2 are two very different things. str1 is an array and str1 stores address of start of array and str2 is a pointer variable that will store the address of character (it can be start of a charatacter array)`
