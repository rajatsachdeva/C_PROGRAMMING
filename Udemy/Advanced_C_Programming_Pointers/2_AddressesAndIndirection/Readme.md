# Addresses and Indirection

`Arrays in C are just sequential data items stored in some location in memory.
Name of the array is the address of the array`

`Unlike many other languages, C doesn't have dedicated string data type, strings are created using character arrays. In C '\0' (null character) is treated as string terminator`
